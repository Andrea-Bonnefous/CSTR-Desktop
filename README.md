# Continuous Flow Reactor Simulator (CTSR)

This project was developed as part of the **Practical Programming in Chemistry (CHE-200)** course at EPFL.

CTSR is a simple yet flexible **continuous reactor simulator** designed to help students and researchers visualize how **recycle streams** affect conversion, flow rates, and concentrations in steady-state systems.

It includes a modular backend and an interactive web interface to adjust key parameters (flow rate, conversion, residence time, recycle ratio, etc.) and observe their effect.# ppchem
