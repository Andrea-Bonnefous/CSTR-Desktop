This project was developed as part of the
**Practical Programming in Chemistry (CHE-200)** course at EPFL.

**CTSR** is a flexible and modular simulator for continuous flow stirred tank reactors. It models
one or more chemical reactions, including recycle streams, reversible and irreversible steps, and
temperature effects.

The tool helps analyze dynamic behavior and optimize key process variables to **maximize the selectivity** 
toward a desired product.

### 🧠 What is a CSTR?

A Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is a fundamental type of reactor used in chemical engineering. In a CSTR, reactants are continuously introduced into a well-mixed tank, and products are simultaneously withdrawn. The constant stirring ensures that the composition and temperature are uniform throughout the reactor. This configuration allows the system to operate at steady-state and makes it particularly suitable for continuous large-scale processes.

CSTRs offer several practical advantages. Their design is relatively simple and easy to scale up, making them cost-effective for industrial production. They allow precise control over key variables such as temperature, pressure, and residence time. In addition, because the reactor is continuously fed and emptied, it is ideal for automated, uninterrupted production lines. The constant mixing also helps avoid the formation of hot spots or concentration gradients, which is especially important for sensitive reactions.

CSTRs are widely used in industrial applications. For example, in the **production of polyethylene** (plastic), CSTRs are employed to maintain a controlled polymerization environment and ensure uniform product quality. The steady-state operation and good heat transfer properties make them suitable for exothermic reactions like this. Another example is **wastewater treatment**, where CSTRs are used in biological reactors to maintain optimal conditions for microbial degradation of pollutants. The continuous flow and mixing ensure that the bacteria are evenly distributed and active throughout the reactor, maximizing the treatment efficiency.
